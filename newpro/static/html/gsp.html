 A swimming pool, swimming bath, wading pool, paddling pool, or simply pool,
 is a structure designed to hold water to enable swimming or other leisure activities.
 Pools can be built into the ground (in-ground pools) or built above ground 
 (as a freestanding construction or as part of a building or other larger structure), 
 and may be found as a feature aboard ocean-liners and cruise ships. In-ground pools 
 are most commonly constructed from materials such as concrete, natural stone, metal, 
 plastic, or fiberglass, and can be of a custom size and shape or built to a standardized 
 size, the largest of which is the Olympic-size swimming pool. </font>
