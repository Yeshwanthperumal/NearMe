Viluppuram District was earlier a part of Cuddalore District. It was then 
bifurcated from Cuddalore and became a separate district on 30th September 
1993. Because of this, the history of Viluppuram district closely resembles 
that of Cuddalore The Cholas were the early rulers. Among these rulers, Karikala 
Chola was the most famous and powerful. For a short period, the Cholas were 
overthrown by Simha Vishnu Pallava and the Region came under the Pallava rule 
for sometime. Vijayalaya Chola again revived Chola rule. This was the beginning 
of great Chola Empire. The later Chola rulers were weak and the power passed on to
the hands of Eastern Chalukyas.</b>
